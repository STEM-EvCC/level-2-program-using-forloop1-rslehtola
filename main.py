mission_names = ['Apollo 11', 'Challenger', 'Curiosity Rover', 'Viking 1', 'Mars Pathfinder', 'Hubble Telescope', 'Apollo 13']
mission_years = [1969, 1986, 2012, 1975, 1996, 1990, 1970]

# variable = 
# print(f"This is the value{variable:.2f}%")

# Counts the total number of space missions.
# Counts the number of successful missions.
# Calculates the success rate of the missions.
# Lists all the missions that were launched before the year 2000.

# Use a for loop to iterate through the list of missions.
# Count the total number of missions.
# Count the number of successful missions.
# Identify and list all missions launched before the year 2000.

# Print the total number of missions.
# Print the number of successful missions.
# Print the success rate as a percentage.
# Print the names of the missions launched before the year 2000.

# Use a counter variable to keep track of the total number of missions and successful missions.
# Use an if statement to check the year of each mission and whether it was successful.
# Calculate the success rate using the formula: (number of successful missions / total number of missions) * 100.
# Use string formatting to display the success rate with two decimal places.
