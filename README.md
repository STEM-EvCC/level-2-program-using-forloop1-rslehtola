# Program: Main

When executed, this program will print the total number of space missions, total 
number of successful space missions, percentage of successful space missions and 
all space missions before year 2000.

# What I learned

Trial and error is messy and long. The list and for statement I created for missions 
pre 2000 was a complete and total nightmare. I used Ai for help on that one after I 
had enough head banging on my computer. Alot of the struggle was centered around 
organization so everything ran properly. Variables were much more complicated on this
assignment. I've discovered the importance of writing everything out step by step
which is a much faster and cleaner process than winging it.
